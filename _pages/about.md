I am an Associate Professor of Linguistics at UC Berkeley. I carry out documentary linguistic work, which is informed by and contributes to linguistic theory. Specifically, I investigate phonological processes and the interfaces of phonology with syntax and morphology.

My research focuses on Kru languages, especially Guébie (Côte d'Ivoire). I have also worked with speakers of Atchan and Ga (Kwa, Ghana), Lobi (Gur, Côte d'Ivoire), Nouchi (urban youth language, Côte d'Ivoire), Dafing (Mande, Burkina Faso), Amharic (Semitic, Ethiopia), Nobiin (Nilotic, Sudan), and Moro (Kordofanian, Sudan).

I also manage [Twisted Tongues](https://www.twisted-tongues.com/), a database management tool for fieldworkers.
