I am a linguistics faculty member at UC Berkeley, where I started in January 2021. Before that I was an Assistant Professor at Georgetown University from 2017-2020. I studied linguistics at the University of Minnesota and UC Berkeley, and I grew up in Wisconsin. I currently live in the Bay Area with my family.

I typically spend my summers in West Africa, where I carry out linguistic fieldwork, primarily in Gnagbodougougnoa, Côte d'Ivoire documenting Guébie (Kru). I have also attended the African Linguistics School in Nigeria and Benin as a student and as an instructor.

In my free time I enjoy hiking, running, bouldering, gluten-free baking, and playing board games. I wear a lot of hats!
